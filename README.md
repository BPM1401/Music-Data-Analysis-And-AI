I am currently enrolled at the New York City Data Science Academy.

In my first project with the Academy, I attempt to create the next Billboard Hit using Data Analysis and Open AI's Jukebox.
The data for this project was obtained from data.world (https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017). 
Credit and gratitude goes to Sean Miller for sourcing and maintaining the database.
